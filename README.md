🧠 ResNet-Based Crowd Counting Model

This project implements a high-accuracy crowd counting pipeline using a fine-tuned `ResNet50` backbone for **regression-based person count estimation** from images. It was designed for the **Kaggle Olympiad Crowd Density Prediction Challenge**, but the architecture is flexible and works on any crowd image dataset with image-wise count annotations.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Regression-based crowd counting** using ResNet50
- 🧪 **Test-time augmentation (TTA)** for more stable predictions
- 🧠 **Transfer learning** with selective fine-tuning
- 🔄 **Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA)** to stabilize training
- 📈 **Learning rate warmup & scheduling**
- 🧹 **Data preprocessing and augmentation**
- ✅ Compatible with **Google Colab**, **PyTorch**, and **Kaggle Datasets**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers pandas tqdm
```

If running on Google Colab:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

---

### 2. Folder Structure Expected

```
📁 /content/drive/MyDrive/kaggle-olympiad-crowd-density-prediction/
├── training_data.csv                  # Columns: id,count
├── output_train/train/seq_000001.jpg # Images for training
├── test/test/seq_01501.jpg           # Images for testing
```

---

### 3. Run Training

Edit the paths in `main.py` and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

* Train the model with **ResNet50 + dropout**
* Apply **data augmentations** like flip, color jitter, rotation
* Save the best model as `resnet50_regressor_best.pth`

---

### 4. Run Inference

The same script performs inference at the end using:

* **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)**: predicts on original and flipped images
* Aggregates predictions and saves results in:

  ```bash
  submission_highacc.csv
  ```

---

## 📊 Model Architecture

```text
ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
└── Remove FC layer
└── AdaptiveAvgPool2d
└── Flatten
└── Linear(2048 → 256) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
└── Linear(256 → 1)  → outputs person count (float)
```

* Only `layer4` and custom regressor are trained (rest frozen)

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metric

We use **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:

$$
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 }
$$

During training, both `Train RMSE` and `Validation RMSE` are monitored.

## 🔑 Possible Improvements

* Use **CSRNet** or **SANet** with density map supervision
* Switch to **EfficientNet** for better feature extraction
* Integrate **multi-scale patches** to boost detail recognition
* Apply **self-supervised pretraining** for better generalization
